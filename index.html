                <h2>Norwich Furry Underground</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Norwich Furry Underground (NFU)</strong> is a small, friendly group of furries (and furry-adjacent folk) based in Norwich.
                        <br><br>
                        We meet up once a month in public venues — usually just somewhere chill to grab a drink and hang out. Everyone’s welcome, whether you’re deep in the fandom, figuring stuff out, LGBTQ+, neurodivergent, or just looking for a group of creative weirdos to vibe with.
                        <br><br>
                        We’re not huge, but the community’s solid, the energy’s good, and there’s always space for new faces. Come say hi!
                    </p>
