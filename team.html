                <h2>ü¶ù RubbishPandy (Charlie)</h2>
                <h3>Founder</h3>
                    <p>
                        RubbishPandy is a Linux-using raccoon who somehow manages to be both extremely clever and completely incapable of focusing on one task for more than 45 seconds. He ‚Äúcoded‚Äù this website in the same way a raccoon might ‚Äúcook‚Äù a meal: by slapping things together, making weird noises, and letting ChatGPT do most of the actual work. CSS? Never heard of her. If it looks nice, that‚Äôs because an AI got tired of being yelled at.
                        <br><br>
                        His attention span is held together with duct tape and Discord pings, and any attempt at structure is immediately derailed by a glowing thing or a VRChat tangent. You‚Äôll often find him in VRChat, rambling about the Invader Zim extended universe, or clipping through the floor in some cursed world he forgot he downloaded at 3AM.
                        <br><br>
                        He started drawing while living in New Zealand ‚Äî broke, stranded, and with literally nothing else to do. What began as survival ended up turning into a comic-book style art habit, heavily inspired by the sharp, unhinged lines of Jhonen Vasquez's work. He still draws, but only when the stars align and he hasn‚Äôt gotten distracted by, say, changing his desktop environment for the fiftieth time this week.
                        <br><br>
                        His raccoon fursona has glowing saliva and eyes because, quote, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool and nobody can stop me.‚Äù Which, fair.
                        <br><br>
                        If you need something done, ask someone else. If you want chaos, weirdly good Python scripts, and a genuinely kind-hearted mess of a person: welcome to the trash pile.

                <h2>üê∂ Theo Beagle</h2>
                <h3>Admin</h3>
                    <p>
                        Theo is the glue that holds this glitter-covered disaster together.
                        <br><br>
                        While RubbishPandy is off arguing with a compiler or getting distracted by shiny cardboard (Magic: The Gathering, again), Theo is calmly solving actual problems ‚Äî like figuring out where the next meet should be, setting up Telegram bots, or reviving the community Minecraft server after Pandy‚Äôs book-based crimes accidentally nuked it from existence. (The server might still be down. No one‚Äôs checked. No one wants to.)
                        <br><br>
                        He‚Äôs the group‚Äôs quiet tech wizard: the one who spins up servers, keeps people organised, and never complains ‚Äî even when he probably should. He‚Äôs the reason we have structured events instead of just a bunch of furries standing in a vague circle asking who‚Äôs actually in charge (spoiler: it's Theo, unofficially and permanently).
                        <br><br>
                        Also? He has a drone. A really nice one. 4K camera. Flies it around at meets like some kind of professional. It's majestic and kind of unfair, honestly.
                        <br><br>
                        Theo plays VRChat too, though not with quite the same unhinged frequency as RubbishPandy. He‚Äôs also in a lovely polyamorous relationship, drinks less than the rest of us, and exudes the calm energy of someone who definitely didn‚Äôt ask to be responsible for this group ‚Äî but took it on anyway because someone had to.
                        <br><br>
                        He doesn't know what to say for his own bio, so we're saying it for him: Theo is brilliant. We literally could not do this without him, and more importantly, we wouldn‚Äôt want to.
