                <h2>ü¶ù RubbishPandy (Charlie)</h2>
                <h3>Founder</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pandy is a Linux enthusiast and self-taught web developer who created and maintains the NFU website. With a background in Python and an eye for digital design, they bring a technical backbone to the group‚Äôs online presence. They are also a digital artist, drawing in a bold, comic-inspired style influenced by artists like Jhonen Vasquez. They picked up illustration while living in New Zealand, and though it began as a means of income, it's since become a creative outlet.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of NFU, they are an active VRChat user and a keen experimenter with open-source tech. Their fursona‚Äîa raccoon with bioluminescent features‚Äîreflects both their creative imagination and their love for the strange and unusual.
